## 🥷 Quick Overview


## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
└── src/
    ├── assets/
    │    └── ...
    ├── components/
    │    └── ...
    ├── content/
    │   └── ...
    ├── layouts/
    │   └── ...
    ├── pages/
    │    └── resources/
    │    │   └── ...
    │    └── index.astro
    └── package.json
```

- `src/routes`: Provides the directory-based routing, which can include a hierarchy of `layout.tsx` layout files, and an `index.tsx` file as the page. Additionally, `index.ts` files are endpoints. Please see the [routing docs](https://qwik.builder.io/qwikcity/routing/overview/) for more info.

- `src/components`: Recommended directory for components.

- `public`: Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the public directory. Please see the [Vite public directory](https://vitejs.dev/guide/assets.html#the-public-directory) for more info.

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
